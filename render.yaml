      # We need to prepend https:// because 'host' only gives domain.com
      # However, Render blueprints don't support formatString deeply in all contexts.
      # The safest way for a web service is to trust that 'host' is the domain.
      # BUT, since we need the full URL, we usually need 'url'. 
      # Since Render says 'url' is invalid (it was deprecated or context specific), 
      # we will use 'host' but we might need to update the app to handle missing protocol 
      # OR just manual override? 
      # Wait, Render documentation says: "host" is just the hostname.
      # Let's use 'host' and assume we can fix the protocol in code OR use a transform if available.
      # Actually, let's fix the FRONTEND code to tolerate a missing 'https://' or 
      # better yet: standard Render blueprints DO support this construction: "https://{host}".
      # But Render.yaml syntax for that is specific.
      
      # Let's try simply using 'host' here, but constructing the full URL inside the app code 
      # often complicates things.
      # The error explicitly lists valid properties: connectionString, host, hostport, port.
      # So 'url' is definitely out.
      
      # Let's use 'host'. We will update the code to Prepend 'https://' if missing.

# Link Database to Backend
# Note: Render Blueprints (render.yaml) automatically inject DATABASE_URL into services 
# that have a 'database' property linked, or we can explicitly set it.
# To link, we add 'region' and 'plan' consistency.
# But explicitly:
# We need to add the database link to the backend service above.

# Corrected Linkage:
# Add this to the backend service in the 'services' list:
#   envVars:
#     - key: DATABASE_URL
#       fromDatabase:
#         name: crypto-db
#         property: connectionString
